This project presents a visual analysis of survey results collected from Data Professionals. The goal was to extract valuable insights from raw Excel data and turn it into a clear and interactive dashboard using Power BI.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (main tool for analysis and visualization)
- Microsoft Excel (raw data source)

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. 📥 Data Import
I started by importing the raw, unstructured data directly from an Excel file into Power BI.

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation
Inside Power BI, I prepared the data for analysis by:
- Removing empty rows and unnecessary columns
- Renaming columns for clarity
- Standardizing text fields and categories
- Fixing data types (e.g., age, salary)
- Creating calculated columns where needed

### 3. 📊 Data Visualization
Then I built an interactive dashboard (see screenshot) to present the key findings:

- ✅ **Total Survey Takers**: 630  
- ✅ **Average Age**: 29.87 years  
- ✅ **Country Distribution**: UK, USA, India, Canada, Others  
- ✅ **Average Salary by Job Title**: Highest for Data Scientists  
- ✅ **Work-Life Balance Score**: 5.74 / 10  
- ✅ **Salary Satisfaction Score**: 4.27 / 10  
- ✅ **Difficulty of Entering the Data Field**: Ranged from "Very Easy" to "Very Difficult"  
- ✅ **Favorite Programming Languages**: Python leads, followed by R, C/C++, JavaScript, Java
